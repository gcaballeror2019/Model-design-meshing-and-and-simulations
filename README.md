# Model-design--meshing-and-and-simulations
 
This repository contains three 3-dimensional models of aortas created with real clinical data. 
The models are originally extracted from the ([Vascular Model Repository](https://www.vascularmodel.com/index.html)) and have been edited personally for my final degree project regarding boundary layer analysis for turbulence and clot formation.
All the models contain their specification files and their usage is correctly cited in the main document.
